# Pitfalls & Known Traps

Append one-liner entries as they're discovered. Every entry should include
the fix, not just the symptom.

## BigQuery

- **Streaming buffer blocks DELETE for 90 min.** Rows inserted via streaming
  `insert_rows_json()` sit in a buffer invisible to DELETE/UPDATE. Fix:
  always use `load_table_from_file(BytesIO(ndjson))` — load jobs land in
  the partition instantly and are free. See `collectors/bq_writer.py`.
- **Query-too-large (>1MB).** DELETE with 1000s of key tuples in OR chains
  overflows. Fix: group by `date`, then `WHERE date=@d AND scope IN UNNEST(@sv)`.
- **Partition pruning requires a literal or param.** Don't do
  `WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY` in a view definition; use
  it in queries, or pass params.

## HubSpot

- **10,000-result hard cap on Search API.** After `after=10000` returns 400.
  Fix: walk N-day windows (we use 7-day windows), reset `after` per window.
- **Lead module is object `0-136`**, separate from Contacts. Use
  `/crm/v3/objects/0-136/search`, not `/contacts/search`.
- **READ-ONLY.** Never PATCH/DELETE/CREATE HubSpot objects without explicit
  user approval in Slack. User reminded this multiple times.

## Meta — November 2025 deprecations

Tested and confirmed:
- ❌ `page_impressions` — use `page_impressions_unique` (reach)
- ❌ `page_fans` — use `page_follows`
- ❌ `page_fan_adds` — use `page_daily_follows_unique`
- ❌ `page_impressions_organic` / `page_impressions_paid` — gone
- ✅ `page_post_engagements` — still works
- ✅ `page_views_total` — still works
- ✅ `page_daily_follows` — still works

IG insights:
- ❌ `impressions` — gone; use `reach` as the closest daily metric
- ✅ `reach` — true daily time-series (period=day)
- ⚠️ `profile_views`, `website_clicks`, `accounts_engaged`,
  `total_interactions` — require `metric_type=total_value` and can't be mixed
  in the same call with day-series metrics. Fetch separately; attribute the
  aggregate to the end_date row.

## Snapchat

- ❌ `conversion_lead` field does NOT exist (we assumed it did)
- ❌ `total_conversions` also rejected by most accounts
- ✅ Safe set: `impressions, swipes, spend, conversion_sign_ups`
- Spend is in **micro-currency** (divide by 1,000,000)

## Google Ads

- **Customer ID must have NO dashes** in API calls. `_customer_ids()` strips.
- `login_customer_id` is the MCC, not the child account.
- PMax campaigns have **no ad groups**; they have **asset groups**. Requires
  a different query (`asset_group` resource).
- Cost in **micros** (`cost_micros / 1_000_000`).

## Windows / Python 3.14 / Console encoding

- Arabic page names crash `print()` on Windows console (cp1252). Fix at
  script top:
  ```python
  try: sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")
  except Exception: pass
  ```

## Replit

- **Don't overwrite root `.replit`** — it runs the agent (`main.py daily`).
  Put dashboard `.replit` in `dashboard/` if deploying as separate repl.
- **Service account JSON on Replit:** use
  `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` secret (paste the JSON string),
  NOT `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (which expects a file path that
  doesn't exist on Replit).

## LinkedIn

- **Access tokens: 60 days. Refresh tokens: 365 days.** Use
  `scripts/linkedin_refresh.py --write-env` weekly. Silent expiry = silent
  collector failure (returns 0 rows, no exception).
- **Header `LinkedIn-Version: 202410`** required on every call. Without it
  you get versioning errors.
- **`adAnalytics` has pivot-explosion limits.** Requesting `pivot=CREATIVE`
  with wide date range paginates slowly — keep windows ≤ 7 days.
- **Lead Gen Forms bypass UTMs.** Leads from LinkedIn native forms land in
  HubSpot with `qoyod_source='LinkedIn'` but `utm_campaign=NULL`. They'll
  bucket into `__no_utm__`. Real fix: pull `/rest/leadFormResponses` and
  join by `form_id → campaign_id`.
- **Campaign names aren't on `adAnalytics`.** Must bulk-fetch via
  `/rest/adCampaigns?ids=List(urn:li:sponsoredCampaign:123,...)` and join.

## Snapchat (extended)

- **Conversion fields are per-account.** Safe across every account:
  `conversion_sign_ups`. Others (`conversion_purchases`, `conversion_add_cart`,
  `conversion_start_checkout`, `conversion_save`, `conversion_subscribe`,
  `conversion_app_installs`) only work if configured on the Pixel. Collector
  now requests the broad set and falls back to `SNAP_STATS_FIELDS_SAFE` on 400.
- **Native currency is per-account; reporting is USD.** `_get_account()`
  detects each ad account's native currency and `collectors/currency.py`
  converts to USD via the SAR peg (`config.USD_SAR_PEG = 3.75`). Native
  values are preserved as `spend_native` / `currency_native`. If a new
  non-SAR/non-USD currency appears, add it to `PEG_RATES_TO_USD` in
  `currency.py` (and document the source — peg vs FX rate).
- **No adset/ad grain yet.** Dashboard can't drill below campaign.
  See `09_open_tasks.md`.

## OAuth (general)

- **Meta page tokens from long-lived user tokens are permanent** — don't
  bother refreshing. Use `scripts/meta_organic_setup.py` to derive.
- **Google refresh tokens** perpetual unless revoked in account settings.
